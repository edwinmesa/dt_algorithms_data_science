#### This is a guide for review of code.


##  Comprehension List
### Big O Notation Complexity: O(n)
### When Used: 
- Creating lists: When you want to generate a new list based on some pattern, expression, or computation, list comprehensions can help you do that in a single line of code.

- Filtering lists: When you need to extract elements from a list that meet specific criteria, list comprehensions can filter the elements based on a condition, resulting in a new list that only contains the desired elements.

- Mapping lists: When you want to transform each element of a list using a function or expression, list comprehensions can be used to apply the transformation and generate a new list with the modified elements.

- Combining lists: When you need to combine elements from multiple lists into a new list, list comprehensions can help you create pairs, tuples, or other combinations.

- Handling nested lists: List comprehensions can handle nested lists, making it easier to flatten lists, perform operations on sublists, or create complex structures like matrices.

##  Loops 
### Big O Notation Complexity: O(n) - O(n^2) - O(Log n)
### When Used: 
- Iterating over Elements in an Array (List):
You can use loops to iterate over each element in an array (list) and perform specific operations on each element.

- Generating Sequences of Numbers:
The range function is ideal for generating sequences of numbers to be used in loops. It allows you to iterate over a specified range of integers easily.

- Summing, Finding Max/Min, or Applying Other Aggregations:
Loops are often used to calculate the sum, find the maximum or minimum value, or apply other aggregations to the elements of an array.

- Repeating an Action a Certain Number of Times:
When you need to repeat a specific action a fixed number of times, loops provide an efficient way to do so.

- Working with Two-Dimensional Arrays (Nested Loops):
Loops are valuable when working with two-dimensional arrays (lists of lists) as they allow you to traverse rows and columns.

- Implementing Searching and Sorting Algorithms:
Loops are fundamental to implement various searching and sorting algorithms like binary search, linear search, selection sort, etc.

- Creating Patterns or Shapes:
When you want to draw patterns, shapes, or certain visual elements, loops, and range can help you accomplish this task systematically.

- Generating and Handling Mathematical Sequences:
You can use loops and range to generate and manipulate mathematical sequences, such as the Fibonacci series or the Pascal's Triangle.

- Custom Countdowns, Timers, or Delays:
Loops combined with the range function are useful for creating countdowns, timers, or introducing delays in your programs.

- String Manipulations and Operations:
When working with strings, loops can be utilized to access each character and perform specific operations based on string length or content.

### Common Examples:
- **sum_array_elements**, **find_max_min_elements**, **reverse_array**, **filter_array**,**remove_duplicates**
